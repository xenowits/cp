After working so hard for the Avengers, u finally find some time to rest.
But, whoa, u know that u are a super Developer, r8? U can't just while away your
time...U ponder for some time and suddenly an idea strucks your head!! Why not create
a personalised web page hosted on github pages, so that his fans(yeah..he does have
a big developer fan base) get to know more about him, he thinks. So, he starts building
a web page from scratch using whatever fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
he had. U vow that u will upgrade your webpage as u learn more throughout your superDeveloper
career.//But, for now u just need to create a basic personalised web page out of scratch.
